Keystone is an open-source project for building trusted execution environments (TEE) with secure hardware enclaves, based on the RISC-V architecture. Our goal is to build a secure and trustworthy open-source secure hardware enclave, accessible to everyone in industry and academia.

Keystone introduces customizable TEE, a new paradigm of building TEE wherein both platform providers and enclave developers customize their TEE to have minimal trusted computing base (TCB), and be highly optimized for the resource usage of each application. This enables a lot of use cases of Keystone enclaves from embedded IoT application to machine learning.
